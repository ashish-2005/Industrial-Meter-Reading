* First, I trained YOLOv8 exclusively for meter detection with help of PyTorch and [ultralystics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), see [here](detector.ipynb)
* Then I also train U-NET with Resnet50 backbone for cropped image segmentation to obtain mask, [here](segmentor.ipynb). For this, I used TensorFlowâ€™s Keras and [SegmentationModels](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models) library which have some pre-defined DL architectures for segmentation tasks.
* Then with help of functions defined in the 203-meter-reader notebook, I obtained the readings from masks, see [meter-reader](meter_reader.ipynb) notebook.
